## History

 FIRST Team #4819, the Flat Mountain Mechanics, is composed of home-educated students as well as teens from three local school districts. Team Members do not necessarily receive school credit for FIRST; they participate solely because they enjoy it. To these gifted kids, FIRST is about learning; winning is just a bonus!

 The group was started in December 2012 with the team number 4819 and a grant from JCPenney covering the cost of the initial Kit Of Parts and 2 district competition. After just a couple team meetings they had decided upon the team name of Flat Mountain Mechanics, as they live in the vicinity of Mt. Pleasant with no mountain in sight.

## Notes

- The team regularly consists of ~17 students and ~8 mentors.
- In 2014 they made it to the World Championship and ranked 22 in the Curie division, winning the Midland district competition to get there.
- They are a member of [GLBR](http://www.first-glbr.org/) and regularly assist in hosting the official Midland event as well as the off-season Great Lakes Bay Bot Bash.
